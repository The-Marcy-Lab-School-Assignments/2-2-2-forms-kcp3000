# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

You need labels for every input in order to put in whatever type of information you wish to put. You can either associate a label with a text-box, or a radio, or even a check-box.

We need labels for each input to associate the label with the specific input. The two ways to do this is by using the `for` attribute and by nesting the input within the label.
