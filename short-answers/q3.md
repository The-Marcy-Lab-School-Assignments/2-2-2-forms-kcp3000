# Question
Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

The first button default behavior is to submit, second also submits, third resets, and the last doesn't submit but *only* when it's inside a form tag. 

# Teacher Feedback

You are correct! In addition, the last button will not submit and will instead perform anything you want it to, it does not have any default behavior so you need to give it some behavior!
